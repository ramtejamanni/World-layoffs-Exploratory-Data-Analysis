## 3️⃣ Tech Stack
The project was built using the following tools and technologies:

 ●  MySQL Workbench – Primary interface for managing the database, writing and executing SQL queries, and performing data analysis.

 ●  SQL (Structured Query Language) – Used for data extraction, transformation, cleaning, aggregation, and generating insights.

 ●  Data Modeling – Created relationships between data points to ensure efficient querying and analysis.

 ●  Data Cleaning Techniques – Applied deduplication, NULL handling, and formatting to maintain data quality and consistency.

 ●  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Conducted various aggregations and breakdowns to analyze layoffs by time, region, industry, and company.


## 4️⃣ Data Source
Source: Kaggle – Layoffs 2023 Dataset

The dataset includes records of layoffs that occurred globally in 2024.
Key fields: Company, Industry, Total Layoffs, Percentage Laid Off, Location, Date, Stage, Funds Raised, and Employees. It offers a valuable foundation for analyzing layoffs across different dimensions: time, geography, funding stages, and sectors.


## 5️⃣ Features / Highlights
